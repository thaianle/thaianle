### 1. [The International Database Project](https://github.com/thaianle/international-database) (Python: Data Analysis and Regression)

My first data project which aims to analyze population growth and the demographic composition of the world and of selected countries/regions. The project also tests the ability of existing regression models to model population growth and compares the performance of regression models to the existing "projected values" in the dataset.

Dataset about the population and demographic profiles of countries and territories around the world, published by the US Census Bureau.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Manipulate and reshape data with NumPy and Pandas.
- Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn in various forms, including bar plots, line plots, histograms, and 100% stacked area plots.
- Test the ability of various regression models in scikit-learn including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to predict population growth in the near future.

### 2. [NYSED School Report Card Project](https://github.com/thaianle/nysed-2024) (SQL, Python: Data Analysis and Clustering, Power BI) **(ongoing)**

An end-to-end project which combines multiple data analysis and modeling techniques, simulating demands for data analysis, prediction, and presentation from different possible stakeholders. The main goal is to get an overall view of the performances of public and charter high schools in New York State for a variety of audience types.

Database contains multiple tables denoting the location, profile, and different evaluation metrics of public and charter schools in New York State during the 2023-24 academic year, curated by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).

**Skills demonstrated:**
- **SQL**: Connect tables and perform analysis on the performance of New York State high schools in the Regents examinations during the 2023-24 academic year.
- **Python**: Visualize and pre-process data with Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Implement clustering models in scikit-learn such as Agglomerative Clustering and K-means.
- (_Future_) **Power BI**: Communicate the overall performance and some in-depth insights into the performance of New York State public and charter high schools.

### 3. [Bank Marketing Project](https://github.com/thaianle/bank-marketing) (Python: Data Analysis and Classification) **(ongoing)**

A project in which I further honed my data analysis and modeling skills, testing different classification models on imbalanced data to help a company focus its marketing strategy on clients who are most likely to use the service in a hypothetical scenario.

Dataset contains profiles of customers targeted in a telemarketing campaign of a Portuguese bank from 2008 to 2010, and whether they chose to subscribe to a term deposit in that campaign or not. The dataset is directly downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Perform exploratory data analysis with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Implement classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and boosting algorithms to predict service subscription (yes/no).
- Identify feature importance from different classification models for feature selection.
- Currently attempting to improve model performance using Optuna, a hyperparameter optimization framework, and taking advantage of ensemble methods on diverse models like Voting or Stacking.
