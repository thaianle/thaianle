1. [The International Database Project](https://github.com/thaianle/international-database) (Python: Data Analysis and Regression)

Dataset related to the population and other demographic characteristics of countries and territories around the world, published by the US Census Bureau.

Analyzed the data by answering several questions related to population trends and changes in demographic compositions. Trained the data on various regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to predict the population in the near future, then comparing the model's prediction with the existing "projected values" in the dataset.

2. [NYSED School Report Card Project](https://github.com/thaianle/nysed-2024) (SQL)

Dataset related to the location, profile, and evaluation metrics of schools in New York State, curated by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).

Used SQL queries to connect tables and analyze the performance of high schools in the Regents Common Core Geometry examinations during the 2023-24 academic year.

3. [Bank Marketing Project](https://github.com/thaianle/bank-marketing) (Python: Data Analysis and Classification) **(ongoing)**

Dataset related to a telemarketing campaign of a Portuguese bank from 2008 to 2010, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data and implemented classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree to predict if a client would subscribe to a term deposit at the bank based on the provided customer and socio-economic information.
