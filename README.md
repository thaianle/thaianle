Hi, I'm Thai An Le (Thai An is my first name), or you can call me An for short.

I'm currently a student at Bates College - Class of 2028, studying Mathematics, Economics, and Digital and Computational Studies.

Some of my current career interests are in data analytics and data science. I enjoy digging deep into large datasets and exploring underlying trends that enrich viewers' understanding of the data and contribute to impactful decisions.

My GitHub account is used to store some of my personal projects as part of my hands-on experience with data analysis/ data science techniques. In the future, I may host codes from my academic coursework if applicable.
