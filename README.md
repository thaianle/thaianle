Hi, I'm Thai An Le (Thai An is my first name, or you can call me An for short). I'm a Mathematics & Economics double major and Digital and Computational Studies minor at Bates College. My current career interests are in research and data analytics/data science, particularly in socio-economic and financial contexts. I am always excited to uncover patterns in the data and contribute my insights to informed decisions.

In addition, I also have extensive experience in writing and language tutoring, helping my fellow students with their classwork while cultivating meaningful relationships. In my free time, I enjoy watching televised quiz shows and sharing the fun facts that I have learned.

This GitHub account is where I store my personal projects as I experiment with different data analysis and machine learning techniques. In the future, I may host codes for my academic coursework.

You can check out my list of projects in [this link](https://github.com/thaianle/thaianle/blob/main/my_projects.md).
