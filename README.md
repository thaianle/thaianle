Hi, I'm Thai An Le (Thai An is my first name), or you can call me An for short.

I'm currently a student at Bates College - Class of 2028, studying Mathematics, Economics, and Digital and Computational Studies.

Some of my current career interests are in data analytics and data science. I enjoy digging deep into large datasets and exploring underlying trends that enrich viewers' understanding of the data and contribute to impactful decisions.

My GitHub account is used to store some of my personal projects as part of my hands-on experience with data analysis/ data science techniques. In the future, I may host codes from my academic coursework if applicable.

1. [The International Database Project](https://github.com/thaianle/international-database) (Python: Data Analysis and Regression)

Dataset related to the population and other demographic characteristics of countries and territories around the world, published by the US Census Bureau.

Analyzed the data by answering several questions related to population trends and changes in demographic compositions. Trained the data on various regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to predict the population in the near future, then comparing the model's prediction with the existing "projected values" in the dataset.

2. [NYSED School Report Card Project](https://github.com/thaianle/nysed-2024) (SQL)

Dataset related to the location, profile, and evaluation metrics of schools in New York State, curated by the New York State Education Department (NYSED).

Used SQL queries to connect tables and analyze the performance of high schools in the Regents Common Core Geometry examinations during the 2023-24 academic year.

3. [Bank Marketing Project](https://github.com/thaianle/bank-marketing) (Python: Data Analysis and Classification) **(ongoing)**

Dataset related to a telemarketing campaign of a Portuguese bank from 2008 to 2010, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the data and implemented classification models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree to predict if a client would subscribe to a term deposit at the bank based on the provided customer and socio-economic information.
