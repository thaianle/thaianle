Hi, I'm Thai An Le (Thai An is my first name), or you can call me An for short.

I'm a Class of 2028 student at Bates College, studying Mathematics, Economics, and Digital and Computational Studies.

My current interests are in research and data analytics/data science, especially in socio-economic and financial domains. I enjoy working out underlying patterns in data and presenting the obtained insights, thus contributing to enriched understanding and impactful decision-making.

This GitHub account is where I store my personal projects as I experiment with different data analysis and machine learning techniques. In the future, I may host codes for my academic coursework.

You can check out my list of projects in [this link](https://github.com/thaianle/thaianle/blob/main/my_projects.md).
