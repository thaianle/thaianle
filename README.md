Hi, I'm Thai An Le (Thai An is my first name), or you can call me An for short.

I'm currently a student at Bates College - Class of 2028, studying Mathematics, Economics, and Digital and Computational Studies.

Some of my current career interests are in data analysis and data science. I enjoy digging deep into large datasets and exploring underlying trends that enrich viewers' understanding of the data and contribute to impactful decisions.

Personal projects:
- [The International Database Project](https://github.com/thaianle/international-database) (ongoing)
- School Report Card Database ([data source](https://data.nysed.gov/downloads.php), coming soon)
